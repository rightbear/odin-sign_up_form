This is the sixth project to work in the "JavaScript Basics"

(2025/03/12) I complete this project with knowledges of HTML and CSS I learned in the previous course. I use HTML concepts such as form. Futhermore, I use advanced CSS concepts such as custom text styles, positoning, child combinator, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors, and more. With advices in Assignment of the project, I use the concept of pseudo-classes and box-shadow to design button style. This activity strengths my skills in HTML and CSS.
